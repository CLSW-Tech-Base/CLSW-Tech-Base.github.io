### Projects

#### **[Finance Visualizer Tool](https://github.com/CLSW-Tech-Base/finance-visualizer)**

_A configuration-driven CLI tool for automated financial reporting and visualization._

- **Core Logic:** Developed a Python-based engine using `pandas` and `matplotlib` to parse CSV/Excel data and generate dynamic charts (Bar/Line) based on a JSON configuration file.
- **Automation:** Integrated with **GitHub Actions** to automatically trigger report generation whenever new data is pushed, simulating a continuous reporting pipeline.
- **DevSecOps Practices:** Implemented a security-focused CI pipeline (`flake8` for linting, `bandit` for SAST, `pip-audit` for dependency scanning) to ensure code quality and safety.
- **Key Tech:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, GitHub Actions, JSON Configuration.

### 🏃 Beyond the Terminal

When I'm not automating workflows or exploring new ways to integrate security into development, you'll find me:

- 🥗 **Meal Prepping:** Resuming a structured lifestyle by designing my own weekly menus and shopping lists.
- 🏋️ **Active Lifestyle:** Staying disciplined through regular **Gym** sessions and **Jogging**.
- 🥾 **Hiking:** Exploring Malaysia's trails (occasionally with my cat carrier 🐱).
